# THREAT Framework Success Metrics and KPIs

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring the effectiveness and success of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Human Risk Evaluation and Assessment Taxonomy (THREAT) framework implementation. These metrics are designed to provide actionable insights for continuous improvement and demonstrate value to stakeholders.

## Detection Effectiveness Metrics

### 1.1 Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)

**Definition**: Average time from the initiation of a threat activity to its detection by security systems or personnel.

**Measurement Method**:
- Track time stamps from threat activity initiation to detection alert
- Calculate average across all detected incidents over reporting period
- Segment by threat type and TTP category

**Target Benchmarks**:
- **Excellent**: < 5 minutes for physical threats
- **Good**: 5-15 minutes for physical threats
- **Needs Improvement**: > 15 minutes for physical threats

**Calculation Formula**:
```
MTTD = Σ(Detection Time - Incident Start Time) / Number of Detected Incidents
```

### 1.2 False Positive Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of security alerts that do not represent actual threats or require security response.

**Measurement Method**:
- Track total number of alerts generated by detection systems
- Classify alerts as true positives, false positives, or false negatives
- Calculate percentage of false positives

**Target Benchmarks**:
- **Excellent**: < 5% false positive rate
- **Good**: 5-15% false positive rate
- **Needs Improvement**: > 15% false positive rate

**Calculation Formula**:
```
False Positive Rate = (False Positive Alerts / Total Alerts) × 100
```

### 1.3 THREAT Coverage Percentage

**Definition**: Proportion of relevant THREAT framework TTPs that are monitored and detectable within the environment.

**Measurement Method**:
- Identify all TTPs relevant to the organization's threat landscape
- Assess detection capability for each TTP
- Calculate percentage of TTPs with adequate detection coverage

**Target Benchmarks**:
- **Excellent**: > 90% coverage of relevant TTPs
- **Good**: 75-90% coverage of relevant TTPs
- **Needs Improvement**: < 75% coverage of relevant TTPs

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Coverage Percentage = (TTPs with Detection / Total Relevant TTPs) × 100
```

### 1.4 Attribution Accuracy

**Definition**: Percentage of detected threats that are correctly attributed to the appropriate threat actor group.

**Measurement Method**:
- Compare initial threat actor attribution to validated attribution post-investigation
- Track accuracy across different threat actor groups (G0001-G0006)
- Calculate overall attribution accuracy rate

**Target Benchmarks**:
- **Excellent**: > 85% attribution accuracy
- **Good**: 70-85% attribution accuracy
- **Needs Improvement**: < 70% attribution accuracy

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Attribution Accuracy = (Correct Attributions / Total Attributions) × 100
```

## Response Effectiveness Metrics

### 2.1 Mean Time to Response (MTTR)

**Definition**: Average time from threat detection to initiation of response actions.

**Measurement Method**:
- Track time from detection alert to first response action
- Measure across different threat categories and severity levels
- Include both automated and manual response actions

**Target Benchmarks**:
- **Critical Threats**: < 2 minutes response time
- **High Priority**: < 5 minutes response time
- **Medium Priority**: < 15 minutes response time

**Calculation Formula**:
```
MTTR = Σ(Response Start Time - Detection Time) / Number of Incidents
```

### 2.2 Incident Resolution Time

**Definition**: Total time required to fully resolve security incidents from detection to closure.

**Measurement Method**:
- Track total time from initial detection to incident closure
- Segment by incident type and severity level
- Include investigation, containment, and recovery time

**Target Benchmarks**:
- **Critical Incidents**: < 4 hours resolution time
- **High Priority**: < 24 hours resolution time
- **Medium Priority**: < 72 hours resolution time

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Resolution Time = Incident Closure Time - Initial Detection Time
```

### 2.3 Response Success Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of threats that are successfully mitigated or neutralized through response actions.

**Measurement Method**:
- Track outcomes of all security incidents and response actions
- Classify outcomes as successful mitigation, partial success, or failure
- Calculate success rate across different threat types

**Target Benchmarks**:
- **Excellent**: > 95% success rate
- **Good**: 85-95% success rate
- **Needs Improvement**: < 85% success rate

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Success Rate = (Successful Responses / Total Response Actions) × 100
```

### 2.4 Coordination Efficiency

**Definition**: Effectiveness of coordination between internal security teams and external partners during incident response.

**Measurement Method**:
- Assess coordination quality through post-incident reviews
- Measure communication timeliness and accuracy
- Track information sharing effectiveness

**Target Benchmarks**:
- **Excellent**: > 90% coordination effectiveness rating
- **Good**: 75-90% coordination effectiveness rating
- **Needs Improvement**: < 75% coordination effectiveness rating

**Measurement Scale**:
```
5-point scale: 5=Excellent, 4=Good, 3=Satisfactory, 2=Poor, 1=Failure
```

## Risk Reduction Metrics

### 3.1 Threat Incident Frequency

**Definition**: Number of successful threat incidents over a specified time period.

**Measurement Method**:
- Track all security incidents resulting in actual harm, loss, or disruption
- Categorize by threat actor type and TTP used
- Calculate trend analysis over time

**Target Benchmarks**:
- **Excellent**: < 2 successful attacks per year
- **Good**: 2-5 successful attacks per year
- **Needs Improvement**: > 5 successful attacks per year

**Calculation Formula**:
```
Incident Frequency = Total Successful Attacks / Time Period
```

### 3.2 Impact Severity Reduction

**Definition**: Average severity of impact caused by successful security incidents.

**Measurement Method**:
- Assess financial, operational, and reputational impact of incidents
- Use standardized impact severity scale
- Track trends in impact severity over time

**Impact Severity Scale**:
- **Level 5**: Catastrophic (> $10M impact or major loss of life)
- **Level 4**: Critical ($1-10M impact or serious injuries)
- **Level 3**: High ($100K-1M impact or minor injuries)
- **Level 2**: Medium ($10K-100K impact or no injuries)
- **Level 1**: Low (< $10K impact)
