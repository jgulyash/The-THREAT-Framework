## UC007 - Hospital Security Management

### Scenario
A major hospital system serving a metropolitan area needs comprehensive security to protect patients, staff, and valuable medical assets from various threats including workplace violence, drug theft, infant abduction, and terrorist attacks targeting healthcare facilities.

### THREAT Framework Application

**Threat Actor Analysis**:
- **G0006 (Lone Actors)**: Focus on individuals with mental health issues, grievances, or personal crises
- **G0002 (Organized Crime)**: Assess threats targeting pharmaceutical supplies and medical equipment
- **G0003 (Terrorists)**: Consider potential attacks on critical healthcare infrastructure

**Workplace Violence Prevention**:
- **T1003 (Social Engineering)**: Train staff to recognize threatening behavior and manipulation tactics
- **T1013 (Exploit Relationships)**: Monitor for exploitation of patient-staff relationships
- **T1025 (Physical Harm)**: Implement early warning systems for potential violence

**Access Control and Asset Protection**:
- **T1008 (Valid Credentials)**: Secure medical staff credentials and visitor access systems
- **T1009 (Physical Bypass)**: Protect pharmaceutical storage areas and restricted medical units
- **T1024 (Asset Acquisition)**: Implement controls for medical equipment and pharmaceutical theft

**Patient and Staff Safety**:
- **T1019 (Internal Reconnaissance)**: Detect unauthorized mapping of hospital layout and procedures
- **T1021 (Internal Movement)**: Monitor movement through sensitive areas like NICUs and pharmacies
- **T1026 (Operational Impact)**: Plan for service disruption and patient care continuity

### Implementation Steps

1. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct comprehensive threat assessment for all hospital facilities
2. **Access Control Enhancement**: Implement role-based access control for all hos
