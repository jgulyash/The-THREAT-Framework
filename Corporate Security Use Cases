## UC001 - Executive Protection Program

### Scenario
A multinational corporation needs to protect C-level executives from targeted threats including nation-state actors, organized crime, and lone wolf attackers who may target executives for kidnapping, assassination, or corporate espionage.

### THREAT Framework Application

**Threat Actor Analysis**:
- **G0004 (Nation-State Actors)**: Assess espionage and influence operations targeting executives
- **G0006 (Lone Actors)**: Evaluate individual threats motivated by grievances or ideological beliefs
- **G0002 (Organized Crime)**: Consider kidnapping and extortion threats

**Reconnaissance Countermeasures**:
- **T1001 (Physical Surveillance)**: Deploy counter-surveillance teams to detect static and mobile surveillance
- **T1002 (Open Source Intelligence)**: Monitor social media and public records for intelligence gathering on executives
- **T1003 (Social Engineering)**: Train executives and staff to recognize pretext calls and elicitation attempts

**Access Control and Movement Security**:
- **T1008 (Valid Credentials)**: Implement multi-factor authentication and regular credential audits
- **T1013 (Exploit Relationships)**: Screen personal and professional relationships for potential exploitation
- **T1019 (Internal Reconnaissance)**: Monitor for unusual facility mapping or schedule analysis activities

**Physical Protection Measures**:
- **T1025 (Physical Harm)**: Deploy protective details and secure transportation
- **T1027 (Physical Exfiltration)**: Secure communication channels and document handling procedures

### Implementation Steps

1. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct comprehensive threat assessment for each executive
2. **Protection Planning**: Develop individualized security protocols based on threat level
3. **Team Training**: Train protection teams on THREAT framework TTPs
4. **Technology Integration**: Deploy surveillance detection and communication security tools
5. **Coordination**: Establish protocols with law enforcement and intelligence agencies

### Expected Outcomes

- **Enhanced Threat Detection**: 40% improvement in identifying surveillance activities
- **Reduced Incident Response Time**: Average response time reduced from 15 to 5 minutes
- **Improved Executive Safety**: Zero successful attacks on protected executives
- **Better Coordination**: Standardized threat assessment methodology across global operations

## UC002 - Insider Threat Detection

### Scenario
A technology company with valuable intellectual property suspects potential insider threats. Employees with authorized access may be stealing trade secrets, sabotaging systems, or providing information to competitors or foreign governments.

### THREAT Framework Application

**Threat Actor Profile**:
- **G0001 (Insider Threats)**: Focus on employees with access to sensitive information
- **Motivations**: Financial gain, grievance, ideological beliefs, coercion by external actors
- **Capabilities**: Legitimate access, knowledge of security procedures, low suspicion profile

**Behavioral Monitoring**:
- **T1008 (Valid Credentials)**: Monitor for unusual access patterns using legitimate credentials
- **T1019 (Internal Reconnaissance)**: Detect employees accessing areas or systems outside their normal scope
- **T1023 (Document Theft)**: Monitor for unusual document access, copying, or photography
- **T1024 (Asset Acquisition)**: Track removal of equipment, prototypes, or materials

**Digital-Physical Correlation**:
- **T1020 (System Discovery)**: Monitor for employees mapping network infrastructure or security systems
- **T1027 (Physical Exfiltration)**: Detect unusual patterns in building egress, parking lot activity, or material removal
- **T1028 (Digital Exfiltration)**: Correlate physical access with digital file transfers or removable media usage

**Attribution and Evidence**:
- **T1031 (Attribution Avoidance)**: Monitor for attempts to conceal identity or misdirect investigations
- **T1032 (Evidence Elimination)**: Detect attempts to destroy documents, clear digital traces, or eliminate witnesses

### Implementation Steps

1. **Baseline Establishment**: Document normal behavior patterns for all employees with sensitive access
2. **Monitoring Systems**: Deploy physical and digital monitoring systems with correlation capabilities
3. **Behavioral Analytics**: Implement machine learning algorithms to detect anomalous behavior
4. **Investigation Procedures**: Develop standardized investigation protocols using THREAT framework
5. **Response Planning**: Create incident response procedures for different threat scenarios

### Expected Outcomes

- **Early Detection**: Identify potential insider threats 60% earlier than traditional methods
- **Reduced IP Theft**: 50% reduction in intellectual property theft incidents
- **Enhanced Evidence Collection**: Comprehensive evidence packages for 95% of investigations
- **Improved Employee Awareness**: 80% of employees complete insider threat awareness training

## UC003 - Facility Security Assessment

### Scenario
A pharmaceutical company operating a research facility needs to assess security vulnerabilities against various threat actors including corporate espionage, organized crime targeting valuable drugs, and activists opposing certain research activities.

### THREAT Framework Application

**Threat Actor Assessment**:
- **G0002 (Organized Crime)**: Evaluate threats targeting high-value pharmaceuticals
- **G0004 (Nation-State Actors)**: Assess espionage risks for proprietary research
- **G0005 (Activists)**: Consider protest activities and potential sabotage

**Access Control Vulnerabilities**:
- **T1009 (Physical Bypass)**: Test effectiveness of locks, barriers, and physical security measures
- **T1010 (Social Engineering Access)**: Assess susceptibility to tailgating, impersonation, and deception
- **T1008 (Valid Credentials)**: Evaluate credential management and access control systems

**Detection and Surveillance**:
- **T1015 (Avoid Detection)**: Test ability to evade surveillance systems and security personnel
- **T1016 (Disable Security)**: Assess vulnerability of cameras, alarms, and communication systems
- **T1021 (Internal Movement)**: Evaluate effectiveness of internal access controls and monitoring

**Asset Protection**:
- **T1024 (Asset Acquisition)**: Assess protection of research materials, equipment, and intellectual property
- **T1027 (Physical Exfiltration)**: Evaluate controls on material removal and document handling
- **T1025 (Physical Harm)**: Consider potential for sabotage or destruction of research

### Implementation Steps

1. **Threat Modeling**: Identify specific threats relevant to pharmaceutical research facility
2. **Physical Security Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of all physical security measures
3. **Penetration Testing**: Authorized testing of security controls using THREAT framework TTPs
4. **Gap Analysis**: Compare current security posture against THREAT framework requirements
5. **Remediation Planning**: Develop prioritized security improvement roadmap

### Expected Outcomes

- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment**: Identification of 95% of security vulnerabilities
- **Risk-Based Improvements**: Security enhancements prioritized by threat actor capabilities
- **Enhanced Access Controls**: 70% improvement in unauthorized access detection
- **Improved Monitoring**: Real-time detection of 85% of suspicious activities
