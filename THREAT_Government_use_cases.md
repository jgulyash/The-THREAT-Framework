- **T1004 (Physical Probing)**: Implement sensors to detect perimeter testing and access point identification
- **T1002 (Open Source Intelligence)**: Monitor social media and public sources for intelligence gathering on base operations

**Access Control and Credential Security**:
- **T1008 (Valid Credentials)**: Implement multi-factor authentication and biometric verification
- **T1017 (Credential Theft)**: Deploy systems to detect badge cloning and credential duplication
- **T1013 (Exploit Relationships)**: Screen personnel relationships and monitor for coercion or compromise

**Attack Prevention and Response**:
- **T1025 (Physical Harm)**: Prepare for direct attacks on personnel and infrastructure
- **T1026 (Operational Impact)**: Plan for service disruption and mission interference
- **T1034 (Responsibility Claims)**: Monitor for terrorist messaging and symbolic communications

### Implementation Steps

1. **Intelligence Assessment**: Conduct comprehensive threat assessment incorporating classified intelligence
2. **Perimeter Enhancement**: Upgrade physical barriers, sensors, and surveillance systems
3. **Personnel Security**: Implement enhanced background checks and continuous monitoring
4. **Response Protocols**: Develop rapid response procedures for various threat scenarios
5. **Multi-Agency Coordination**: Establish coordination with intelligence agencies and law enforcement

### Expected Outcomes

- **Enhanced Perimeter Security**: 90% improvement in detecting unauthorized approaches
- **Reduced Response Time**: Average response time reduced from 8 to 3 minutes
- **Improved Threat Detection**: 85% accuracy in identifying suspicious activities
- **Better Intelligence Integration**: Real-time threat intelligence sharing with partner agencies

## UC005 - Government Building Protection

### Scenario
A federal building housing multiple government agencies requires updated security protocols to protect against various threats including terrorism, activism, and targeted attacks on government officials. The building serves the public while maintaining security for sensitive government operations.

### THREAT Framework Application

**Multi-Threat Environment**:
- **G0003 (Terrorists)**: Assess threats from groups targeting government symbols and officials
- **G0005 (Activists)**: Evaluate protest activities and potential escalation to violence
- **G0006 (Lone Actors)**: Consider individuals with grievances against government agencies

**Visitor and Access Management**:
- **T1010 (Social Engineering Access)**: Implement robust visitor screening and escort procedures
- **T1003 (Social Engineering)**: Train staff to recognize impersonation and deception attempts
- **T1008 (Valid Credentials)**: Secure employee and visitor credential systems

**Intelligence and Surveillance**:
- **T1019 (Internal Reconnaissance)**: Monitor for facility mapping and schedule analysis
- **T1020 (System Discovery)**: Detect attempts to identify emergency procedures and security systems
- **T1002 (Open Source Intelligence)**: Monitor public sources for threats against specific agencies

**Emergency Response Planning**:
- **T1034 (Responsibility Claims)**: Prepare for terrorist messaging and media manipulation
- **T1036 (Symbolic Communication)**: Understand potential symbolic targeting of government facilities
- **T1026 (Operational Impact)**: Plan for service disruption and continuity of government operations

### Implementation Steps

1. **Threat Assessment**: Conduct agency-specific threat analysis for all building occupants
2. **Visitor Management**: Implement advanced visitor screening and tracking systems
3. **Emergency Planning**: Develop comprehensive emergency response and evacuation procedures
4. **Staff Training**: Train all personnel on security awareness and emergency procedures
5. **Interagency Coordination**: Establish communication protocols with federal, state, and local agencies

### Expected Outcomes

- **Enhanced Visitor Security**: 100% screening of all visitors with 95% accuracy
- **Improved Emergency Response**: Coordinated response with average activation time of 2 minutes
- **Reduced Security Incidents**: 60% reduction in security-related incidents
- **Better Threat Intelligence**: Real-time sharing of threat information across agencies

## UC006 - Border Security Operations

### Scenario
A border security agency needs to improve detection of smuggling operations, human trafficking, and potential terrorist infiltration. The operation covers multiple border crossing points and requires coordination between various agencies and international partners.

### THREAT Framework Application

**Criminal Network Analysis**:
- **G0002 (Organized Crime)**: Focus on sophisticated smuggling and trafficking operations
- **G0003 (Terrorists)**: Assess potential for terrorist border crossings and supply chain infiltration
- **G0004 (Nation-State Actors)**: Consider state-sponsored smuggling and intelligence operations

**Surveillance and Intelligence**:
- **T1001 (Physical Surveillance)**: Deploy advanced surveillance systems along border corridors
- **T1005 (Acquire Infrastructure)**: Monitor for establishment of safe houses and operational bases
- **T1002 (Open Source Intelligence)**: Collect intelligence on smuggling routes and criminal networks

**Operational Security**:
- **T1022 (Area Expansion)**: Track movement patterns and route expansion by criminal organizations
- **T1027 (Physical Exfiltration)**: Detect and intercept smuggling operations and illegal crossings
- **T1030 (Coordination)**: Monitor communication patterns and coordination between criminal groups

**Multi-Agency Operations**:
- **T1029 (Communication)**: Intercept and analyze criminal communications
- **T1031 (Attribution Avoidance)**: Understand how criminal organizations avoid detection and attribution
- **T1032 (Evidence Elimination)**: Detect attempts to destroy evidence and eliminate witnesses

### Implementation Steps

1. **Intelligence Fusion**: Establish multi-agency intelligence sharing and analysis center
2. **Surveillance Enhancement**: Deploy advanced sensors and monitoring systems along border
3. **Operational Coordination**: Develop joint operations procedures with partner agencies
4. **Training Programs**: Train border security personnel on THREAT framework concepts
5. **International Cooperation**: Establish intelligence sharing with international partners

### Expected Outcomes

- **Enhanced Detection**: 50% improvement in detecting smuggling and trafficking operations
- **Improved Interdiction**: 70% increase in successful interdiction of illegal activities
